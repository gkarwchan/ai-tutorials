    "3. Copilot-x will do **Gathering Context** and filter while the user type the words\n",
    "4. Open tabs: Try to get the relevant code from the **open tabs** of the IDE, hoping its relevant to the code\n",
    "5. Snippeting: It is selective of what code should include in the prompt context, so it divide the code into snippest (idealy no more than 60 lines of code), and do **score** them to see if they are relvant to the typing code. To do that it uses an algorithm called **`Jaccard Index Similarity`**"
