Check if there is a service in Windows running Postgres and stop it to resolve the issue.\\n2. Try changing the port number you are connecting to, such as using port 5431 instead of 5432.\\n3. If the database or role does not exist, ensure that Postgres is running by checking with `docker ps`. If necessary, consider building your instance on a different port like 8080 instead of 5432.\\n4. Ensure that the correct database and user credentials are being used while connecting.\\n5. If the root user does not exist, consider changing the port, modifying environment variables, or checking for similar cases on developer forums like Stack Overflow for potential solutions.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the connection and password authentication issues with your Postgres database.'"
